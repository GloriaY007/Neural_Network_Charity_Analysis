# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

This project aims to nalyze the impact of each donation to Alphabet Soup on its recipients. It also aims to analyze which donation are worth redistributing and will have the most impact using Python TensorFlow library and Neural networks.

## Overview of the analysis
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
